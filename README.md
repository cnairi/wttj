# Node version

If you're using nvm to handle your node versions, just run "nvm use" at the root of our project. Or just check the node version in .nvmrc and be sure to use it before installing our project.

# ESLint & Prettier rules

We have decided to use wttj config front for our project. For more info go to https://github.com/WTTJ/wttj-config-front, check .eslintrc.js and prettier.config.js.

# Responsiveness
