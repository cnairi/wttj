# Node version

If you're using nvm to handle your node versions, just run "nvm use" at the root of our project. Or just check the node version in .nvmrc [v14.16.0] and be sure to use it before installing our project.

# Run project locally

Be sure to use the right version of node, then run "yarn start" at the root of the project.

# ESLint & Prettier rules

We have decided to use wttj config front for our project. For more info go to https://github.com/WTTJ/wttj-config-front, check .eslintrc.js and prettier.config.js.

# Responsiveness

Our website is responsive. We did our best to offer the same quality on mobile, tablet & desktop.

# Deployment and build

https://wttj-camille-nairi.herokuapp.com/ We used Heroku to deploy our app. Our app is connected to Github and to our wttj repo. Automatic deploys from main are enabled.
